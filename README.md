# Performance with Java

I have created this project when studying the book Java Performance - The definitive guide. So, all the source examples presented here are based on examples presented byt the author of the book. Some source codes are different in response of my own study purposes and regarding the analysis I was interested to run.

## About the benchmarks

All performance analysis and benchmarks were measured using an environment with the following specifications:

### Hardware
- Processor: 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5
- Memory: 8 GB DDR 3
